**Library** [speech_recognition Git](uploads/be27d4c55467b11f9f9383ae8369248a/speech_recognition_)

The library is a very big and packed piece of software, it will let you do a lot of things, things like:
*  Transcribe an audio file
*  Save audio data to an audio file
*  Recognize speech input from a microphone
    *  Calibrate the recognizer energy threshold for ambient noise levels
    *  Listen to a microphone in the fore and background

The library is python based and it wasn't too complicated to get a hang on, the given examples help alot.

**Hardware Requirements**

The only thing you need is a microphone and a system that can use python and has a terminal or IDE that can run python scripts. 

We tested everything on Mac High Sierra, Raspberry Pi 3b+ and Windows 10.

**Software Requirements**

To use all of the functionality of the library, you should have:
*  Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.3+
*  PyAudio 0.2.11+
*  PocketSphinx
*  FLAC encoder
