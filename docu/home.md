The Smart Mirror is a mirror that should shorten your time in the morning. This is done by showing the information that you would normally gather after your visit to the bathroom directly on the mirror itself. Furthermore, the Smart Mirror is a combination of sensors that must be hands-free. This is done by means of one or more webcams and a microphone. Think of hand gesture controls and speech recognition. In addition, it should shorten your time, after visiting the mirror, in different ways.

To make your morning a little faster we brainstormed about what actions you do after your visit of the bathroom. Because our target group consists of people who study or go to work every day, we have kept traveling in our minds. In addition, our target group often has enough appointments and meetings through the day.

After that we thought of the following things:
*  You can check what time ur train or bus leaves
*  You can check for traffic jams
*  You can read the latest news
*  You can check what weather you can expect that given day
*  You can check all your calendar notifications

In addition, we also realised that not every user should read the same news, or travel to the same location. Hence, we also want to implement facial recognition.
